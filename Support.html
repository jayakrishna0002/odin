                How will my money be used?
            </h2>
            <p>Your money will be used to pay for the costs of running The Odin Project. This includes paying for the servers that host the website, the domain name, and any other costs associated with running the project. Your money does not go towards paying the maintainers. All of our expenses are documented directly on the Open Collective website.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>How can I donate?</h2>
            <p>You can donate via Open Collective, by setting up a recurring donation or with a one time payment.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>What form of payments can I use?</h2>
            <p>You can usually pay by credit card through our Open Collective page. They also offer bank transfer, Paypal, or other means in addition to or instead of credit card payments. When you go through the contribution flow, you'll see all the available payment methods.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>What happens if you receive more donations than needed?</h2>
            <p>Any extra money that we receive will be used to improve The Odin Project, or will be saved for future needs. This includes paying for new features, paying for new servers, and paying for any other costs associated with running the project.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>How do I cancel my recurring donation?</h2>
            <p>You can cancel your recurring donation at any time through your Open Collective profile.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>What are the benefits of donating?</h2>
            <p>Your donation helps us continue to provide a world-class and completely free coding curriculum for anyone and everyone eager to learn. We believe that this material should be available for free to anyone that needs it, and donations from those that have the means to contribute help keep it available for everyone!<br>In additon to the above, donors get a special 'backer' role in our discord server as a small bit of recognition.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>How do I get the 'backer' role on Discord?</h2>
            <P>Use the /opencollective command in our discord server to verify your Open Collective account. You will then be automatically given the 'backer' role. You will be prompted to provide your Open Collective username, which is found in the URL of your Open Collective profile. For example, if your profile URL is https://opencollective.com/rick-astley your username is rick-astley.<br></P>
            <h2>Do users with the 'backer' role get any exclusive benefits?</h2>
            <p>No. The role is just a way for us to show our appreciation for your support</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Does becoming a donor mean I get priority support in the chat?</h2>
            <p>No. We feel strongly that everyone should be treated equally in our community, regardless of whether or not they are a donor.</p>
